Books II

Specification

Build a beautiful and useful search form that lets the user enter a book title. The single page app will use AJAX to fetch the data for the chosen book from Google Books and display it on the page. Display the cover, as a bare minimum. You might like to work on advanced search modes as well.

Sample URL

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=title:Ulysses

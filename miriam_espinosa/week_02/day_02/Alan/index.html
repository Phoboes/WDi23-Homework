      <h2>Alan Turing Biography</h2>
      <h4>Mathematician, Educator(1912–1954)</h4>

      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p>Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in <a href="file:///Users/miriam/WDi23-Homework/miriam_espinosa/week_02/day_02/Alan/hometown.html">London</a>. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. That paper also introduced the "Turing machine. His papers on the subject are widely acknowledged as the foundation of research in artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h3>Cryptanalysis and Early Computers</h3>

      <p>During World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime code-breaking, particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley Park, the GCCS wartime station, where he made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including specifying the bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher German Enigma encrypted signals. Turing’s contributions to the code-breaking process didn’t stop there: He also wrote two papers about mathematical approaches to code-breaking, which became such important assets to the Code and Cypher School that the GCHQ waited until April 2012 to release them to the National Archives of the United Kingdom.

      <br>Turing moved to London in the mid-1940s, and began working for the National Physical Laboratory. Among his most notable contributions while working at the facility, Turing led the design work for the Automatic Computing Engine and ultimately created a groundbreaking blueprint for store-program computers. Though a complete version of the ACE was never built, its concept has been used as a model by tech corporations worldwide for several years, influencing the design of the <strong>English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15—credited by many in the tech industry as the world’s first personal computer</strong>—among other computer models.

      <br>Turing went on to hold high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and later the computing laboratory at the University of Manchester in the late 1940s. <strong>He first addressed the issue of artificial intelligence in his 1950 paper, "Computing machinery and intelligence,"</strong> and proposed an experiment known as the “Turing Test”—an effort to create an intelligence design standard for the tech industry. Over the past several decades, the test has significantly influenced debates over artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h3>Homosexuality, Conviction and Death</h3>

      <p>Homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s, so when Turing admitted to police that he had had a sexual relationship with the perpetrator, 19-year-old Arnold Murray, he was charged with gross indecency. Following his arrest, Turing was forced to choose between temporary probation on the condition that he receive hormonal treatment for libido reduction, or imprisonment. He chose the former, and soon underwent chemical castration through injections of a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year, which eventually rendered him impotent.

      <br>As a result of his conviction, Turing's security clearance was removed and he was barred from continuing his work with cryptography at the GCCS..

      <br>Turing died on June 7, 1954. Following a postmortem exam, it was determined that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. The autopsy concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia due to cyanide poisoning and ruled a suicide.

      <br>In a June 2012 BBC article, philosophy professor and Turing expert Jack Copeland argued that Turing's death may have been an accident: The apple was never tested for cyanide, nothing in the accounts of Turing's last days suggested he was suicidal and Turing had cyanide in his house for chemical experiments he conducted in his spare room.</p>
